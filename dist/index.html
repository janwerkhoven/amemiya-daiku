        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Amemiya-daiku</h3>
        <p>Amemiya-daiku is located in Yamanashi-prefecture, Enzan, Japan. The company's foreman is Amemiya Kunihiro. The company focuses on traditional Japanese carpentry techniques. Techniques such as squaring logs with the Japanese broadaxe and adze, cutting large timbers in boards with the wide bladed-ripsaw and the traditional way of assembling the frame using the mortise and tenon and more complicated joints. The objective is to build sustainable environmental friendly homes. This by using as much hand tools as possible, manual labor and ancient knowledge and skills. The homes are not only friendly for their surroundings but also for their inhabitants. By living close to nature, the true meaning of a home can come true: comforting peoples mind. Local materials such as trees and earth are used. This in order to keep the ecological footprint as low as possible from the beginning of the building process.</p>
